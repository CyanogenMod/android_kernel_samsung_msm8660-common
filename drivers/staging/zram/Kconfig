	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See zram.txt for more information.

	  This option adds additional debugging code to the compressed
	  RAM block device driver.

	help
	  Select the compression method used by zram.
	  LZO is the default. Snappy compresses a bit worse (around ~2%) but
	  much (~2x) faster, at least on x86-64.  LZ4 needs testing.
